3.objects and its internal representation in Javascript

 Answer:
     
 1. A JavaScript object is a collection of named values.
 
 2.variables are containers for storing the values.
  
 3.objects are like big size containers we can store more data on particular 
   object name, and each value is separated or indexed by different 
   key value pairs.
 
 4.by using constructor we can create N number of objects by using 
   new keyword.
 
 5.JavaScript has a number of predefined objects. In addition, you can create your 
   own objects. You can create an object using an object initializer.        Alternatively, you can first create a constructor function and then instantiate    
   an object invoking that function in conjunction with the new operator.

 6.Define the object type by writing a constructor function. There is a strong    convention, with good reason, to use a capital initial letter.
   Create an instance of the object with new.

 7.Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword, constructor 
   function allows to create multiple objects.

 8.In object we can declare multiple datas with different datatypes but one thing we should
   consider the reference not repeated two times.
