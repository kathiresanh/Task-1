a) statically typed language and dynamically typed language:
   
   answer:
       statically typed language:
             1. Here we have to declare the datatypes of the variables.
             2. type checking of variable done at compile time so we can able to 
                fix the error at earlier stage.
             3. these are statically typed language  Java, C, and C++.
       dynamically typed language:
             1. Here we do not declare the type of datatypes of variable.
             2. type checking of variable performs at run time.
             3. some examples of dynamically typed languages are Python, Javascript

b) scripting language vs programming language:
    
   answer:
        scripting language: 
            1. it is a type of programming language does not require a explicit
               compilation.
            2. it is designed for runtime system to automate the execution of task.
            3. here we can run the program immediately.
          
         programming language:
            1. here by using programming language we can communicate with computers
               through set of instruction.
            2. her the instructions are compiled and the source code is converted
               machine codes.
            3. some programming languages are c, c++, java.
